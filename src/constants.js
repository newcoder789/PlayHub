//When constants are scattered across multiple files, managing them becomes difficult, especially when changes are required. A constants.js file centralizes all constants in one place.

// .env values are strings by default and require parsing if other types (like objects or numbers) are needed.

// Storing all constants in .env can clutter it unnecessarily.
